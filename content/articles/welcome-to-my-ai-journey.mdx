# Welcome to My AI Journey

I'm JP Narowski, and I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the world of AI. As a CTO and founder with years of experience building products and teams, I'm fascinated by how AI is transforming software development and product creation.

## Why AI?

The pace of change in AI is unlike anything I've seen in my career. From LLMs to code generation, from image synthesis to multimodal models - the possibilities are endless. I want to:

- **Learn in public** - Document my experiments and discoveries
- **Share practical insights** - Focus on real-world applications
- **Build with AI** - Create tools and products that leverage AI
- **Connect with others** - Join the community of AI builders

## What to Expect

This blog will be my primary platform for sharing:

- Technical deep dives into AI tools and models
- Practical tutorials and how-to guides
- Thoughts on AI's impact on software engineering
- My experiments and side projects
- Lessons learned from building with AI

I'll also be creating video content, but written content will always be the core of this site.

## Let's Build Together

If you're interested in AI, whether you're just starting out or already deep in the weeds, I'd love to connect. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jnarowski) or reach out via [email](mailto:jp@sourceborn.com).

Let's explore this fascinating field together.

*Stay tuned for more content. I'm planning to publish regularly as I dive deeper into AI.*
