# Building with AI Tools: A CTO's Perspective

As a CTO who's been building software for over two decades, I've witnessed many technological shifts. But nothing compares to the rapid transformation AI is bringing to software development.

## The Current Landscape

AI tools are everywhere:
- **Code Generation**: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude
- **Design**: Midjourney, DALL-E, Figma AI
- **Product**: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning
- **DevOps**: AI-powered testing and deployment

## What's Actually Working

Not all AI tools are created equal. Here's what I've found genuinely useful:

### 1. Code Assistance
AI pair programming has become indispensable. I'm writing code faster, with fewer bugs, and learning new patterns along the way.

```typescript
// AI helps with boilerplate and pattern completion
async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Documentation
AI excels at:
- Writing clear documentation
- Generating API specs
- Creating examples and tutorials

### 3. Problem Solving
When stuck on a tricky problem, AI can suggest multiple approaches I might not have considered.

## The Reality Check

**AI won't replace developers**. But developers who use AI will replace those who don't.

Here's why:
- AI lacks context about your specific system
- It can't make architectural decisions
- It doesn't understand your business domain
- It can't debug complex issues (yet)

## My Advice

1. **Start Small**: Pick one AI tool and master it
2. **Stay Critical**: Always review AI-generated code
3. **Learn the Fundamentals**: AI works best when you understand what it's doing
4. **Experiment**: Try new tools, see what sticks
5. **Share Knowledge**: Help your team adopt AI effectively

## Looking Forward

The pace of AI development is staggering. What seems magical today will be commonplace tomorrow. The key is staying curious and adapting quickly.

I'm excited to share more about specific tools and techniques in upcoming posts. Stay tuned!
