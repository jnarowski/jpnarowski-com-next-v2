# About Me

I live in Denver, CO, and I'm the oldest of 6 siblings. I've been entrepreneurial from a young age, and I'm deeply passionate about technology and computers.

## Professional Background

I'm currently the **Head of Engineering at Spectora**, a leading home inspection software company. My career has been defined by building and leading technical teams.

### Previous Ventures

- **KarmaCRM** - Founded a B2B SaaS CRM that grew to serve speakers and entrepreneurs
- **Development Agency** - Co-founded and managed a team of 20+ people, including 10 developers
- **Clickflow** - Served as CTO, focusing on technical leadership and product development

## My Philosophy

> "I 'Huckleberry Finn'ed' my way into entrepreneurship"

I focus on creating **self-managing teams, processes, and code**. The intersection of technology and business is where I thrive, combining deep technical expertise with entrepreneurial drive.

## Personal Interests

- **Skiing** - Living in Denver gives me easy access to world-class slopes
- **Cooking** - I love experimenting in the kitchen
- **Reading** - Always learning and expanding my perspective
- **Computer Technology** - Still passionate about building and creating

## Early Career

My journey started with destroying and rebuilding computers (much to my parents' dismay, I'm sure). That hands-on curiosity evolved into a passion for coding and creating delightful user experiences. I believe great software should be both powerful and intuitive.
