2. Run the appropriate test command
3. Report test results including:
   - Number of tests passed/failed
   - Test coverage percentage (if available)
   - Any failing test details
4. If tests fail, analyze the failures and suggest fixes
5. Check for:
   - Flaky tests
   - Missing test cases
   - Tests that need updating
