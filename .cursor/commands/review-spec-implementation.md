# Review Spec Implementation

Reviews a previous agent's implementation work by comparing the provided spec file against actual code changes. Identifies discrepancies and documents all findings in a Review Findings section appended to the spec. The documented issues can then be addressed by running `/implement-spec` on the updated spec file.

## Variables

- $spec-file-path: $1 (required) - Path to the spec file to review against (e.g., `.agent/specs/feature-name.md`)
- $format: $2 (optional) - Output format: "text" or "json" (defaults to "text" if not provided)
- $max-reviews: 3 - This is a constant (maximum review iterations allowed)

## Instructions

- **REVIEW ONLY** - This command does not implement fixes
- **Evidence-based** - Every finding must cite file:line and quote spec requirements
- **Priority-focused** - Only document HIGH and MEDIUM priority issues (see guidelines below)
- **Pragmatic mindset** - Ask "would this block a PR merge?" not "could this be better?"
- **Project standards** - Check `.agent/docs/code-review-standards.md` for detailed review methodology. If that file is missing, look for best practices in CLAUDE.MD
- **Maximum Iterations:** Reviews stop automatically after 3 iterations
- Act as a professional code auditor, not a nitpicking perfectionist
- If $format is not provided, default to "text"

## Review Scope & Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to determine what issues to document:

### HIGH Priority (Blocking - Must Fix)

- Broken functionality (syntax errors, undefined variables, obvious logic errors)
- Missing required features explicitly stated in spec
- Security vulnerabilities (exposed secrets, injection risks)
- Critical bugs (data corruption, crashes, infinite loops)
- Missing error handling that will cause crashes

### MEDIUM Priority (Should Fix)

- Significant code duplication (same logic in 3+ places)
- Missing tests for new features
- Pattern violations (not using project's logger, error handling, or path utilities)
- Complex functions (>50 lines or 3+ nesting levels)
- Unhandled edge cases (null checks, empty arrays)

### LOW Priority (Do NOT Document)

- Naming suggestions, style preferences, micro-optimizations
- Comments, variable ordering, theoretical refactors
- **Skip these entirely - they create noise**

## Review Methodology

**Evidence-Based Review:**

- Cite specific locations: `file.ts:123`
- Quote spec requirements: "Spec section 2.3 requires..."
- Check for justifying comments before flagging unusual patterns
- Distinguish obvious errors from code that needs manual testing

**Priority-First Approach:**

- Review HIGH priority issues first
- Then MEDIUM priority issues
- Stop when complete - don't search for problems

**False Positive Prevention:**

- Read surrounding context (comments, docs) before flagging
- Verify spec actually requires what you think it requires
- Check if deviation is intentional and documented

**Completion Criteria:**

- All spec requirements implemented
- No HIGH or MEDIUM priority issues
- Production-ready, not perfect

## Workflow

1. **Validate Inputs**

   - Verify spec file exists at `$spec-file-path`
   - Determine main branch (main/master) using `git branch` or git config
   - **Auto-detect review iteration:**
     - Scan spec file for existing "Review Findings" sections
     - Count sections: "Review Findings" = 1, "Review Findings (#2)" = 2, etc.
     - Find highest iteration number (e.g., if #1, #2, #3 exist, highest is 3)
     - If no "Review Findings" sections exist, highest is 0
     - Set `$review-count = highest + 1`
   - **Check max iterations:**
     - If `$review-count > $max-reviews`: **EXIT IMMEDIATELY** with success status
     - Skip all remaining steps (2-5)
     - Return message: "Maximum review iterations (3) reached. No further automated reviews will be performed. Please manually review the most recent Review Findings section to determine if remaining issues need to be addressed."
   - If `$review-count <= $max-reviews`: Continue to step 2

2. **Gather Context**

   - Run `git diff [main-branch]...HEAD` to see all code changes
   - Run `git log [main-branch]...HEAD --oneline` to see commit history
   - Read spec file completely (`$spec-file-path`)
   - Read `.agent/docs/code-review-standards.md` for detailed review methodology
   - Read CLAUDE.md or similar project docs for additional context (if exists)
   - **If $review-count > 1:**
     - Find and read the MOST RECENT `## Review Findings` section in the spec
     - This will be the section with the highest number (e.g., if #1, #2, #3 exist, read #3)
     - Note all previously identified issues to track which were fixed

3. **Perform Review**

   - **If $review-count > 1, verify previous findings were addressed:**
     - For each issue from the most recent Review Findings section:
       - Check if it was fixed in the code
       - If NOT fixed, carry it forward to new findings
       - If fixed, note it as resolved (don't re-document)
   - **For each spec phase/requirement:**
     - Verify it's implemented and working
     - Check acceptance criteria met
     - Apply HIGH/MEDIUM priority filters from guidelines above
   - **Check code quality** (if applicable to project):
     - Error handling patterns
     - Type safety
     - Code duplication
     - Edge cases
   - **Cite evidence**: Use `file.ts:123` format and quote spec requirements
   - **Check context**: Read comments before flagging unusual patterns

4. **Document Findings**

   - Append new `## Review Findings` section to spec file using template below
   - **Section naming:**
     - First review ($review-count = 1): `## Review Findings`
     - Subsequent reviews ($review-count > 1): `## Review Findings (#2)`, `## Review Findings (#3)`, etc.
   - This preserves the history of all review iterations in the same file
   - **Only include phases that have issues** - phases with zero issues should be mentioned in "Positive Findings" if notable
   - **Only include priority sections (HIGH/MEDIUM) when issues exist at that level** - don't create empty sections
   - **Add status indicators** for each phase: ✅ Complete, ⚠️ Incomplete, ❌ Not implemented
   - Group issues by phase first, then by priority within each phase
   - Include: file:line, quoted spec requirement, actual vs expected
   - **If no issues found at all:** Still add Review Findings section with "No issues found" message

5. **Report Results**

   - Summary: iteration X of 3, files reviewed, issue counts by priority
   - Next step:
     - If issues found: `/implement-spec $spec-file-path` then `/review-spec-implementation $spec-file-path`
     - If no issues found: Implementation is complete

## Review Findings Template

Use this template when adding the Review Findings section to the spec file.

- For first review: use `## Review Findings`
- For subsequent reviews: use `## Review Findings (#2)`, `## Review Findings (#3)`, etc.
- **IMPORTANT**: Append to the end of the spec file, preserving all previous Review Findings sections
- Example of multiple iterations in same file:

```md
[... rest of spec ...]

## Review Findings

**Review Date:** 2025-01-15
**Reviewed By:** Claude Code
**Review Iteration:** 1 of $max-reviews
[... findings from first review ...]

## Review Findings (#2)

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't assume implementation is correct - verify everything against the spec
- Don't skip reading the entire spec - requirements may be scattered throughout
- Don't just look at the latest commit - review ALL changes in the branch
- Don't attempt to fix issues during review - document them thoroughly instead
