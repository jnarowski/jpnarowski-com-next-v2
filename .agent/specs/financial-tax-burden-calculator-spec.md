# Feature: Financial Tax Burden Calculator

## What We're Building

A tax calculator that helps users estimate their federal tax liability on large income events (like phantom equity payouts) and model the impact of various tax reduction strategies including active business losses, real estate professional status, and oil & gas investments. The tool provides transparent calculations with URL-based state persistence for easy scenario sharing.

## User Story

As a high-income individual receiving a large one-time compensation event
I want to understand my true after-tax proceeds and evaluate different tax strategies
So that I can make informed decisions about whether complex tax strategies are worth pursuing

## Technical Approach

Client-side Next.js application with pure TypeScript calculation functions. All state persists in URL query parameters for zero-backend simplicity and easy scenario sharing. Tax calculations follow 2025 federal tax brackets with support for multiple tax reduction strategies. UI follows existing die-with-zero calculator patterns with form inputs, real-time calculations, and detailed breakdown sections.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Verify navigation structure supports new tool route
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - May need utility functions for number formatting
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Verify theme colors available for tax calculator
- `package.json` - Verify all dependencies available (no new ones needed)

### New Files

- `src/app/tools/tax-calculator/page.tsx` - Main calculator page component
- `src/lib/tax-calculator.ts` - Core tax calculation logic (pure functions)
- `src/lib/tax-calculator.test.ts` - Unit tests for tax calculations
- `src/components/tax-calculator/TaxCalculatorForm.tsx` - Form component for inputs
- `src/components/tax-calculator/StrategyCard.tsx` - Reusable card for each strategy
- `src/components/tax-calculator/TaxSummary.tsx` - Summary card showing total tax and net proceeds
- `src/components/tax-calculator/CalculationBreakdown.tsx` - Detailed step-by-step calculations
- `src/components/tax-calculator/StrategyEducation.tsx` - Educational section explaining strategies
- `src/hooks/useTaxCalculatorState.ts` - URL-based state management hook

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Set up core tax calculation engine with 2025 federal tax brackets, define data structures for all tax strategies, implement pure calculation functions that can be thoroughly tested, and document the mathematical formulas for transparency and professional verification.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Build the form components for inputting payout amounts and strategy parameters, implement URL state management for scenario persistence, create the summary and breakdown display components, and wire up real-time recalculation on any input change.

### Phase 3: Integration

Compose the main page layout, add educational content explaining each strategy and qualification criteria, implement mobile-responsive design matching site aesthetics, add prominent disclaimers about educational purpose, and polish UX with validation and helpful hints.

## Notes

### Tax Calculation Formula Reference

**2025 Federal Tax Brackets (Single Filer):**
- 10%: $0 - $11,600
- 12%: $11,601 - $47,150
- 22%: $47,151 - $100,525
- 24%: $100,526 - $191,950
- 32%: $191,951 - $243,725
- 35%: $243,726 - $609,350
- 37%: $609,351+

**Standard Deduction 2025:** $14,600 (single filer)

**Progressive Tax Calculation Example:**
For $1,000,000 taxable income:
1. First $11,600 × 10% = $1,160
2. Next $35,550 × 12% = $4,266
3. Next $53,375 × 22% = $11,743
4. Next $91,425 × 24% = $21,942
5. Next $51,775 × 32% = $16,568
6. Next $365,625 × 35% = $127,969
7. Remaining $390,650 × 37% = $144,541
**Total Tax: $328,189**

**Business Loss Strategy:**
- Directly reduces AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)
- Must be from active trade or business (Section 162)
- No dollar limitation for active losses
- Applied before standard deduction

**Real Estate Professional Strategy:**
- Requires 750+ hours in real estate activities
- More than 50% of personal services time
- Material participation in rental activities
- Converts passive losses to active losses
- Passive losses otherwise limited to passive income

## Review Findings

**Review Date:** 2025-10-16
**Reviewed By:** Claude Code
**Review Iteration:** 1 of 3
**Branch:** tax-calculator
**Commits Reviewed:** 0 (all changes uncommitted)

### Summary

The implementation is substantially complete with all core functionality working. The tax calculator has been fully implemented with all required components, comprehensive unit tests (33 passing), successful build, and proper UI implementation. However, there is **one critical bug** in the tax bracket calculation logic that causes slightly incorrect tax calculations, and several minor code quality issues that should be addressed.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-4)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All core calculation logic and tests implemented

#### HIGH Priority

- [x] **Tax bracket calculation contains off-by-one error**
  - **File:** `src/lib/tax-calculator.ts:198`
  - **Spec Reference:** "Progressive Tax Calculation Example: For $1,000,000 taxable income: First $11,600 × 10% = $1,160"
  - **Expected:** Income in bracket should be calculated as `maxIncome - bracketMin`
  - **Actual:** Code calculates `const incomeInBracket = maxIncome - bracketMin + 1;` (adds +1)
  - **Fix:** Remove the `+ 1` from line 198. The correct formula is:
    ```typescript
    const incomeInBracket = maxIncome - bracketMin;
    ```
  - **Impact:** This causes tax calculations to be slightly higher than they should be across all brackets. For example, the first bracket calculates $11,601 × 10% instead of $11,600 × 10%, adding $0.10. This error compounds across all brackets, making the total tax calculation inaccurate.

### Phase 2: UI Components - Form & State (Tasks 5-6)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All form components and state management implemented

### Phase 3: UI Components - Display (Tasks 7-9)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All display components implemented with proper styling

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Tasks 10-14)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Main page, share functionality, disclaimers, and styling all implemented

#### MEDIUM Priority

- [x] **Unused imports in tax calculator page**
  - **File:** `src/app/tools/tax-calculator/page.tsx:32`
  - **Spec Reference:** N/A (code quality issue)
  - **Expected:** All imports should be used or removed
  - **Actual:** `err` variable in catch block is defined but never used
  - **Fix:** Either use the error for logging or prefix with underscore: `catch (_err)`

- [x] **Unused import in StrategyCard component**
  - **File:** `src/components/tax-calculator/StrategyCard.tsx:1`
  - **Spec Reference:** N/A (code quality issue)
  - **Expected:** Only used imports
  - **Actual:** `CardTitle` is imported but never used
  - **Fix:** Remove `CardTitle` from imports

- [x] **Unused import in TaxSummary component**
  - **File:** `src/components/tax-calculator/TaxSummary.tsx:2`
  - **Spec Reference:** N/A (code quality issue)
  - **Expected:** Only used imports
  - **Actual:** `Wallet` icon is imported but never used
  - **Fix:** Remove `Wallet` from imports

- [x] **Unused import in test file**
  - **File:** `src/lib/tax-calculator.test.ts:15`
  - **Spec Reference:** N/A (code quality issue)
  - **Expected:** Only used imports
  - **Actual:** `TAX_BRACKETS_2025` is imported but never used in tests
  - **Fix:** Remove `TAX_BRACKETS_2025` from imports

### Positive Findings

- **Comprehensive test coverage:** 33 unit tests covering all calculation functions, strategies, edge cases, and integration scenarios
- **Clean component architecture:** Well-organized separation of concerns with dedicated components for form, display, and education
- **Excellent URL state management:** Proper hydration handling, base64 encoding, and validation for malformed URLs
- **Professional UI/UX:** Beautiful design with proper dark mode support, responsive layout, and clear visual hierarchy
- **Strong educational content:** Detailed strategy education with links to IRS publications and clear qualification requirements
- **Proper disclaimers:** Prominent legal disclaimers at top and bottom of page with comprehensive coverage
- **Type safety:** Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces and type definitions
- **Build success:** Project builds successfully with no errors
- **All tests passing:** 100% test pass rate

### Review Completion Checklist

- [x] All spec requirements reviewed
- [x] Code quality checked
- [x] All findings addressed and tested

### Next Steps

1. **Fix the HIGH priority issue immediately** - The tax bracket calculation bug must be corrected
2. **Clean up unused imports** - Address the MEDIUM priority linting warnings
3. **Re-run tests** after fixing the bracket calculation to ensure calculations are accurate
4. **Verify manual calculations** against IRS tax tables after the fix

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# After implementing fixes:
/implement-spec .agent/specs/financial-tax-burden-calculator-spec.md

# Then review again:
/review-spec-implementation .agent/specs/financial-tax-burden-calculator-spec.md
